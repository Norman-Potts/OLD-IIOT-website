****Changed name of repo to OLD_IIOT_website because I wanted to start over, but not have to use git to look back at this project. 





IIOT_website 

This project was an attempt at making a website for a customer. 
That customer was Industrial Internet of Things Labartory at Mohawk College.
Currently this project is not completed, It is too large for me to debug and may use unsecure compoentents. 

How ever to run the project as a whole use 'npm start' in the backend fold, that will start the backend, and run 
react scripts for the two react apps. 

The two react apps for the public facing frontent and the other for the administrator. 
iiot_website is the public end.
iiot_controller is the administrator end. 

iiot_backend is the server that handles requests for app data. 



To finish this project a development strategy should be considered.




1. Refresh my skills by completing the list I have created. 
2. Have a development plan that uses a flag to know when development is in three separate peices and when it is as one unit to pull together. 
4. Save this version of the project as is, do not touch.
3. Rebuild from scratch using up to date skills and practices. 
5. Break project into separate pieces. 



To run this project you must be using node v12.14.1 and npm v6.13.4.
